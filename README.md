## Smart Glasses Application for Visually Impaired Individuals

### Overview

This software application is designed to assist visually impaired individuals using smart glasses equipped with advanced functionalities for hazard detection, navigation, and object recognition.
Divided into 2 major modes; Input and Output, the main focus of the project is to combat dependency of visually impaired people.

### Features
### *Modes*

**Input Mode**: Allows users to interact with the system using voice commands or tactile inputs.

**Output Mode**: Provides auditory and/or tactile feedback to the user based on the detected hazards and navigation instructions.

### *Functionalities*

**Hazard Detection**: Uses YOLO v8 for real-time object detection to identify potential hazards in the user's environment, such as obstacles or traffic.

**Navigation**: Integrates Mapbox Navigation API to provide turn-by-turn directions and location-based information to help users navigate safely.

**Accessibility**: Ensures all interactions and feedback are accessible through audio cues or tactile feedback, tailored for visually impaired users.

### *Requirements*

Smart glasses with camera and microphone capabilities.
Compatible with devices supporting YOLO v8 model and Mapbox API.
